# Welcome to my Battleships game. The rules are as follow:
# 1. The grid size is changeable by the player, it goes without saying that the larger the grid, the more difficult it is to win
# 2. The computer places 5 ships within the grid and the player tries sink the computer's ships using board coordinates
# 3. The turn counter is limited to 10 shots per player and at the end of the game if the player does not sink all ships, computer wins
# 4. Ships that are hit are marked with  "X" and shots missed are marked with "()"
# 5. If the player sinks all the ships, the computer Loses, otherwise the computer Wins
# To play the game, please input the grid size and when prompted input the coordinates for your shots
# Good Luck, Have Fun!
